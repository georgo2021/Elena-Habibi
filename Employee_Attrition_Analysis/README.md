# 👩‍💼 Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes HR data to understand employee attrition patterns and key factors influencing turnover. It aims to help organizations improve retention strategies by identifying at-risk employee groups based on data.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Classification modeling

## 📈 Key Steps
- Cleaned and explored HR data using pandas
- Visualized relationships between attrition and features such as age, job role, and satisfaction level
- Encoded categorical variables and analyzed correlations
- Trained a classification model to predict likelihood of attrition

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use EDA to identify patterns in HR datasets
- Feature engineering and preprocessing for classification
- Gained insight into employee behavior through data
- Built a simple model to assist HR in making data-driven decisions
