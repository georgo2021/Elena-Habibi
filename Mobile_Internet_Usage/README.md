# ðŸ“¶ Mobile Internet Usage Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes mobile internet usage data from a sample of users to identify usage patterns and statistically test whether the average usage exceeds a specific threshold. The study applies descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Descriptive statistics
- One-sample hypothesis testing (t-test)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps
- Cleaned and explored internet usage data
- Visualized distribution of usage among individuals
- Conducted a one-sample t-test to evaluate population mean
- Interpreted p-value and confidence interval for hypothesis validation

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Applied hypothesis testing using real-world behavioral data
- Strengthened understanding of p-value, t-statistics, and confidence intervals
- Developed visual explanations to support statistical findings
